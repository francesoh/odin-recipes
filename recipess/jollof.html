        <h3> Procedure</h3>
            <ol>
        
            <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. 
                Drain and set aside.</li><br>
            <li>Blend the Tomatoes and Peppers:
                If using fresh tomatoes, blend them with the Scotch bonnet peppers until you have 
                a smooth tomato puree. If using tomato paste, skip this step.</li><br>
            <li>Sauté Onions:
                In a large pot or skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped 
                onions and sauté until they become translucent.</li><br>
            <li>Add Tomato Sauce:
                Add the tomato puree (or tomato paste) to the pot. Stir and cook for about 10-15 
                minutes, allowing the tomatoes to reduce and the oil to separate from the sauce.</li><br>
            <li>Season the Sauce:
                Add thyme, curry powder, bay leaves, and salt to the tomato sauce. Stir well to 
                incorporate the spices.</li><br>
            <li>Add Stock (or Water):
                Pour in the chicken or vegetable stock (or water) and stir. Bring the mixture to a 
                simmer.</li><br>
            <li>Add Rice:
                Add the rinsed and drained rice to the pot. Stir to ensure the rice is well coated 
                with the tomato sauce.</li><br>
            <li>Add Protein and Vegetables (Optional):
                If you're using protein (e.g., chicken, beef, or shrimp), add it to the pot at 
                this point. Also, add diced vegetables if desired.</li><br>
            <li>Simmer and Cover:
                Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the 
                Jollof rice simmer for about 20-30 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking, 
                and add more stock or water if needed.</li><br>
            <li>Check for Doneness:
                The rice should absorb the sauce and become tender. Make sure the protein is fully 
                cooked.</li><br>
            <li>Serve:
                Once the rice is cooked and the sauce has been absorbed, remove the bay leaves, 
                fluff the rice with a fork, and serve your delicious Jollof rice hot.</li>
