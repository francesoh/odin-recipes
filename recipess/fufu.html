        <h2>Description of Fufu</h2>
        <p><strong> Fufu</strong> is a staple food in many African countries, including Nigeria and Ghana. 
            It's a starchy dish made by pounding boiled cassava, yams, or plantains into 
            a dough-like consistency. Typically served as an accompaniment to soups and stews, 
            fufu has a neutral taste and is valued for its ability to soak up flavorful sauces.</p>

        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>

        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the Cassava: Start by peeling the cassava root to remove the tough outer skin. 
                You can also cut it into smaller pieces for easier handling.</li><br>

            <li>Boil the Cassava: Place the peeled cassava pieces in a large pot, and cover them with 
                enough water. Boil the cassava until it becomes soft and easily pierced with a fork. 
                This can take approximately 20-30 minutes.</li><br>
                
            <li> Drain and Cool: Drain the boiled cassava and allow it to cool for a few minutes. 
                 Cooling makes it easier to handle.</li><br>
                
            <li> Pound or Mash: Traditionally, fufu is pounded in a mortar and pestle, but you can 
                 also use a fufu machine or even a stand mixer with a paddle attachment. Pound or 
                 mash the cassava until it becomes smooth and dough-like in consistency. You may 
                 need to add small amounts of water during this process to achieve the desired 
                 texture.</li><br>
                
            <li> Shape and Serve: Once the fufu reaches a smooth, stretchy consistency, remove it 
                from the mortar or machine. It should be pliable and easy to shape. Divide it into 
                small portions and shape them into round balls, logs, or any desired form.</li><br>
                
            <li>Serve: Fufu is typically served as an accompaniment to soups, stews, or sauces. 
                It is often used to scoop up the sauce or soup, and its mild flavor complements 
                the flavorful dishes it accompanies.</li><br>
                
                Note: The process for making fufu from yam or plantains is similar, with the main 
                difference being the choice of the primary ingredient and the potential variations in 
                texture and flavor.
