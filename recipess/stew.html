        <h3>Procedure</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Brown the Meat:<br>
                Heat the cooking oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. 
                Add the cubed meat and brown it on all sides. This adds flavor to the stew. 
                Remove the meat and set it aside.</li><br>
            <li>Sauté the Onions and Garlic:<br>
                In the same pot, add the chopped onions and minced garlic. Sauté them until they 
                become soft and translucent.</li><br>
            <li>Add the Vegetables:<br>
                Add the chopped carrots, potatoes (if using), and celery (if using) to the pot. 
                Sauté them for a few minutes until they start to soften.</li><br>
            <li>Return the Meat:<br>
                Put the browned meat back into the pot and stir to combine it with the 
                vegetables.</li><br>
            <li>Add the Tomatoes:<br>
                Pour in the can of diced tomatoes (including the juice) and stir well.</li><br>
            <li>Season the Stew:<br>
                Add bay leaves, thyme, rosemary, salt, and pepper to the pot. Adjust the seasonings 
                to your taste.</li><br>
            <li>Pour in the Broth:<br>
                Pour the broth into the pot, making sure it covers the meat and vegetables. 
                Adjust the amount of liquid based on your desired stew thickness.</li><br>
            <li>Simmer:<br>
                Bring the stew to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let it 
                simmer for 1-2 hours, or until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded. 
                Stir occasionally.</li><br>
            <li>Taste and Adjust:<br>
                Taste the stew and adjust the seasonings as needed. You can also add more liquid if 
                the stew becomes too thick during cooking.</li><br>
            <li>Serve:<br>
                Remove the bay leaves and serve your delicious stew hot. It's often enjoyed with 
                bread, rice, or mashed potatoes.
                Feel free to customize your stew with your favorite vegetables and spices to create 
                your own unique flavor profile</li><br>
